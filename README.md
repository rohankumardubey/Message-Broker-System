# Eventflow - A Message Broker System

Eventflow is an experimental message broker system, developed to understand the working of a message broker. In essence, Eventflow captures the basic features of enterprise event stream processing softwares like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. Eventflow is also similar to the jobs queue use case of Redis. This system is developed purely for learning purposes and not suitable for production. Go through this README to learn more about message brokers and its use cases. Instructions to setup Eventflow in your own device, and implementation details of Eventflow's API are also provided. 

## What is a message broker?

A message broker is a system that facilitates the communication between different applications, services and system. In a production environment, message brokers effectively translate messages between formal messaging protocols. It hence allows for easy flow of data between applications and services, even if they're written in different languages and follow different protocols.
